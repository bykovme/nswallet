## NS Wallet (Xamarin)



## Your private data should be reliably secured

NS Wallet is secure offline storage for your confidential and sensitive information (like passwords, credit cards numbers, pin codes and any other information you want to keep in secret). Privacy is our highest concern, that's why our password manager is fully offline solution (no clouds, no sync with servers), your data is stored ONLY on your smartphone or tablet and it is encrypted with AES-256 cyper algorythm using your master-password as encryption/decryption key.
