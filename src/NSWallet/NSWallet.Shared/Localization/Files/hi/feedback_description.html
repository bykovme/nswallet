<h1>We need your voice!</h1>
Unlike many other apps, we do not track the users and their behavior, we keep the application clean to make sure that 
its security is on maximum possible level. Due to the fact that we do not track the users and our solution is fully offline, 
we have only limited feedback from you and it is very difficult to understand which features are useful and which are not, 
what troubles you have and what new features you like. Now everything will change! 
<br /><br />
We created feedback platform where you can finally give us your feedback voting for desired changes in NS Wallet or even 
propose your own new incredible features and we will let other users vote for it.

<b>Use the button above to vote for new features!</b>
