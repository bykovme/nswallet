    <h2>How to import backup file from your old phone to your new phone</h2> 

    <h4><b  style="color:red;">IMPORTANT!</b> NS Wallet is fully offline solution, it does not have any backups anywhere except phone, 
    it is YOUR responsibility to store backup data outside the phone/tablet or to transfer your data from one phone to another.
    We clearly undrstand that it is not very convenient in modern world when Intrnet is everywhere and everybody store the data in clouds
     but this behaviour is done with the reason and this reason is security. 
     Your data stays on your phone and your phone only and no one bit of your data is transferred without your full personal control. 
    That's why NS Wallet is so secure!

        (you can use cloud service like Google Drive, Dropbox or any other app with ability to transfer files which you trust,
         it can be even transferred as attachment of mail)</li>
        <li>Find the backup file on your new phone in the app or service you selected above and use the options "Send to.." or "Open with.." 
        of the content menu to send the file to NS Wallet</li>
